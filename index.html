    <h1 class="tosh">okazi soup</h1>
    <p class="classy">
      There is a Nigerian expression which says
      <span class="first-span">"she who has the soup holds the man"</span>which
      is why soup continues to be the central point of many Nigerian meals.I had
      thought that with the abundance of rice in Nigeria,swallows will take a
      second place but no. Most of us just like the simplicity of eating which
      is use your hands, cut the swallow, dip it in the soup, accompany it with
      small fishes and vegetables and swallow or chew.Come to think of it this
      process I just described in a few words is quite complex.Have you thought
      of how our brain processes this? I mean when the soup gets to the mouth
      the ball of the pounded yam is swallowed and the vegetables and meats
      remain in the mouth before is chewed and enjoyed before being
      swallowed?This is quite intriguing.So back to the matter of soups, it is
      Ofe Okazi soup from <span>Abia state</span>.

        after cooking.</span
