          <h3>Okazie Soup</h3>
          <p>
            There is a Nigerian expression which says "she who has the soup
            holds the man" which is why soup continues to be the central point
            of many Nigerian meals.I had thought that with the abundance of rice
            in Nigeria,swallows will take a second place but no. Most of us just
            like the simplicity of eating which is use your hands, cut the
            swallow, dip it in the soup, accompany it with small fishes and
            vegetables and swallow or chew.
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Come to think of it this process I just described in a few words is
            quite complex.Have you thought of how our brain processes this? I
            mean when the soup gets to the mouth the ball of the pounded yam is
            swallowed and the vegetables and meats remain in the mouth before is
            chewed and enjoyed before being swallowed?This is quite
            intriguing.So back to the matter of soups, it is Ofe Okazi soup from
            <span>Abia state</span>
            <span
              >Nigeria, and trust me this soup was so good that there were no
              leftovers after cooking.</span
